# Gizmoball

## Summary
This is a Java application that allows people to play Gizmoball.
Gizmoball is a version of pinball, an arcade game in which the object is to keep a ball moving around in the game, without falling off the bottom of the playing area. The player controls a set of flippers that can bat at the ball as it falls. The advantage of Gizmoball over a traditional pinball machine is that Gizmoball allows users to construct their own machine layout by placing gizmos (such as bumpers, flippers, and absorbers) on the playing field.
Gizmoball has a graphical user interface with two modes - building mode and running mode.

## To run the app:
Run ./src/view/GBallView.java
